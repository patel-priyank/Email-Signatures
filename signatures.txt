Slaying spreadsheets and sipping on coffee
Channeling my inner Beyonc√©
Putting the 'pro' in procrastination
Fueled by caffeine and occasional existential crises
Professional typo maker
Occasional pun enthusiast
Task slayer
Making magic happen
Barely alive
Casual Excel enjoyer
Enjoying quality time with Amazon Prime
Part time Gossip Girlie
Crying at my code
Hoping to win a lottery
Wishing I were OOO
Please do hesitate to contact me
Contact someone other than me
Peace out
Stay cool
Cheers
TTYL
Ciao
Thx
Later hater
XOXO
Keep it real
Namaste
Live long and prosper
Peace and love
Chaos and hatred
Adios
See ya
Whatever floats your boat
Have a nice day, or don't
No offense, but you're wrong
Just saying, you could do better
Sorry not sorry for being honest
Good luck with that mess
As you wish, but I disagree
Bless your heart, you poor thing
With all due respect, you're clueless
Sincerely, I don't care
Part time comedian
Sipping mimosas
Wake me up when September ends
Lukewarm regards
This too shall pass
Have a panic attack, you've earned it
Still dead inside
Have a meltdown, as a treat
Awkward vibes only
You matter (just not that much)
